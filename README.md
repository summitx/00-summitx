# 00-summitx

This organization contains all code related to the omnidirectional ground
vehicle SummitX provided by Robotnik Automation. Most of the repos here are
forked from their own organization. This organization has been created so that
we can continue to develop on the codebase. The Robotnik Team has been slow to
respond to issues and fixes, justifying the need for this organization.
