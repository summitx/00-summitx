# 00-summitx

This organization contains all code related to the omnidirectional ground
vehicle SummitX provided by Robotnik Automation. Most of the repos here are
forked from their own organization. This organization has been created so that
we can continue to develop on the codebase. The Robotnik Team has been slow to
respond to issues and fixes, justifying the need for this organization.

## Setup
This organization will mostly contain ROS packages. As such it is important to
create a catkin workspace. Here we give instructions for setting this up.

Create a catkin workspace called `summitx_cws` along with its associated `src`
directory:

    mkdir -p summitx_cws/src

Clone any repos you will be working on inside this folder.

To build the source code of the workspace run the following inside `summitx_cws`:

    catkin build
